Tenative Name: Attack Vector

Gameplay Overview:
	"Infinite Runner" with an ending
	Users control a pointer in a computer system as they outrun the garbage collector. This is the epitome of hollywood hacking.
	Players use Up down left right, or WASD to move through a level

	The level is randomly generated in front of the player, with a few exceptions:
		New blocks are created on the fly in front of the player
		Old blocks are eaten by the garbage collector. The player could create an unwinnable situation by backing themselves into a corner. Sad life for them, shouldn'tve done that.
		Each 16x16 room can have a few obsticals in them to make them more exciting. Gaps and pits litter the rooms, forcing the player to use their ships's weapon to fill them.


	Winning:
		Players survive a set amount of time running through the maze. There's no additional action besides moving forward and avoiding the GC
		After players survive a set amount of time, the game attempts to spawn a goal tile. Stepping on this goal tile advances the player to the next level.

		Players progress through a series of levels starting from Guest to Root.

		Each time the player advances a level, the background shifts, starting from purple to red

		There's a bumpin ass soundtrack
		it's good
